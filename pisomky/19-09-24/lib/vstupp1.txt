Every cloud has a silver lining.
You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink.
You never know what you can do until you try.
What the eye doesn't see, the heart doesn't grieve over.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
Sickness in the body brings sadness to the mind.
One swallow doesn't make a summer.
Never put off till tomorrow what can be done today.
Laughter is the best medicine.
A friend in need is a friend indeed.
A true friend is someone who reaches for your hand, but touches your heart.
False friends are worse than open enemies.
As one door closes, another always opens.
A wise man shall hold his tongue till he sees his opportunity.
